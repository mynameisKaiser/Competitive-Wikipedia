## üëÄ About The Project

You might be suprised to learn about Wikipedia Speedruns, where the goal is to get from a starting article to a target article in the shortest amount of clicks and time possible. Although Wikipedia Speedrun websites exist, this project seeks to "gameify" the Wikipedia experience whilst simultaneously allowing users to familiarise themselves with wiki structures and find information more efficiently.

Some of the features that set Competitive Wikipedia apart are:

- A truly fair speedrun clock that account for loading times and has a pause function
- Anti-cheat measures, such as control/f or cmd/f attempts and inspector injects (potentially)
- A competitive environment, with both local and online leaderboards, as well as shops where players can purchase buffs and advantages
