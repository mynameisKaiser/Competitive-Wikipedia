## About The Project

Although Wikipedia Speedrun websites exist do their job as advertised, this project seeks to "gameify" the Wikipedia experience whilst simultaneously allowing users to familiarise themselves with Wiki structures and find information more efficiently.

Some of the features that set Competitive Wikipedia apart are:

- A truly fair speedrun clock that account for loading times and has a pause function
- Anti-cheat measures, such as control/f or cmd/f attempts and inspector injects (potentially)
- A competitive environment, with both local and online leaderboards, as well as shops where players can purchase buffs and advantages
